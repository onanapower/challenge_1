# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

## Project Description

This project is meant to refactor the html and css of a marketing agency. The project is an on-the-job ticket, which means you'll begin with starter code that I will need to modify. The job is actually meant to sort out a very important: **accessibility**.
The project will folllow the scout rule to leave a clean and understandable coding environment

For someone who does not understand what refractor means here, it is taking an existing code and improve it without changing what it does yet meeting a certain set of standards or implement a new technology in it. In this challenge.

## Goal Of The Project

Web accessibility is an increasingly important consideration for businesses. It ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. Making a website accessible is also good for business for many reasons, one of them being that accessible sites are better positioned in search engines like Google. It also helps companies avoid litigation that can occur when people with disabilities cannot access their website.

Even though accessibility is a broad topic that can include complex requirements,The basic is for easy access and stressless use of a product. lots of research has shown that the amount of page views and page ranking in search engines has a lot to do with accessibility.

**Important**: An important rule to follow when working with someone else's code is the **Scout Rule**, which recommends that you always leave the code a little cleaner than when you found it. In doing this,
HTML attributes in the code will fall in sequential order
image and iccon elemens will contain an alt attribute
HTML elements will follow a logical structural independent of styling and positioning
Semantic HTML will be used through out the project
Heading attribute will also fall in seqential order

## Goal

To impress clients, We do go the extra mile and improve the codebase of a project for long-term sustainability. For example, I always make sure that all links are functioning correctly. Also, rework the CSS to make it more efficient by consolidating CSS selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and including comments before each element or section of the page.

### User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

### Acceptance Criteria

Your website must meet accessibility standards. You can achieve this completing the following:

- Semantic HTML elements can be found throughout the source code
- HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
- Image and icon elements contain accessible `alt` attributes
- Heading attributes fall in sequential order
- Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title

### Resources:

- [Semantic HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp)
- [Image `alt` attributes](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_img_alt.asp)

### Mock-Up

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality before refactoring:

![The Horiseon webpage includes a navigation bar, a header image, and cards with text and images at the bottom of the page.](Assets/01-html-css-git-challenge-demo.png)

> **Note**: This layout is designed for desktop viewing, so you may notice that some of the elements don't look like the mock-up at a resolution smaller than 768px. Eventually you'll learn how to make elements responsive so that your web application is optimized for any screen size.
